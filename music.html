                      <h2>Celtic Music &amp; Pipebands</h2><br>
                      <p>Celtic Music is one of the most identifiable and recognized aspects of Scottish heritage and culture. Even to the casual listener, Scottish music is easily recognized for its unique quality and style. It has a definite power and presence that demands attention. This is not music that can be ignored as "background" music. People find that they are either magnetically drawn to it or beat a hasty retreat away from it. This is Gaelic "soul" played with intense feeling and listened to as an emotional experience.

                    Scotland and the other Celtic countries have produced an amazing amount of folk music over the past 500 years. The distinctive sound of this music underlines the cultural heritage shared by Scotland, Ireland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Galicia in Spain and the Brittany coast of France. Many tunes known for hundreds of years throughout these regions are distinguished only by different names, words and variations in performing styles. Within each region there are also tunes that are unique to that area alone.<br><br>
                    Celtic folk music is an ethnic musical form that continues to have contemporary music written in the same style and feel as it was centuries ago.<br><br>
                    <strong>The Saturday Night Celtic Concert!</strong><br><br>
                    Music starts at 6:30 PM in the Celtic Rock Tent and is included in the price of your Saturday admission ticket. All musical guests of the festival will be on hand to perform and entertain! Invite your friends who didn't come out to join you for the show - tickets at the door will be $10 for those not attending during the day.<br><br>

            As singer and flute and whistle player, Jil has completed many recording projects and performed at Celtic festivals and concerts across the US as well as in Canada, Scotland, and Israel with the band Henri’s Notions, guitarist Scooter Muse, Scottish singer Ed Miller, Scottish fiddler John Taylor, the band Vulcan Eejits!, the Vogt Family Contra Band, and others.
Jil brings to any audience a wonderful listening experience from haunting ballads and upbeat songs to toe-tapping tunes with a smooth delivery that never fails to bring both smiles and tears in every performance.<br><br>
A long time guitar player, 1968 marked a big change in the music Scooter Muse had digested during the folk years. Bonnie and Clyde had a banjo on the soundtrack – Earl Scruggs’ Foggy Mt. Breakdown – and from that point on he never looked back.<br><br>
Finally, after the summer of 1972, with the sound of Dueling Banjos on any folkie’s mind, Scooter purchased his first banjo, took a few lessons – and almost 40 years later has been fortunate to win countless banjo competitions throughout the southeast including the Tennessee Valley Championships 8 times.<br><br>
He has played banjo with bluegrass legends, Claire Lynch, Vassar Clements and a host of others as well as handling first call banjo duties for the world famous Muscle Shoals, Alabama recording industry.
While at the Briarfield Bluegrass Festival in Alabama in the early 80’s, another life-changer for him was experiencing the progressive Celtic sounds of a great band, Touchstone. That show launched him into the world of Celtic music on banjo, and ultimately, moving into the world of open tunings on the guitar. In the 90’s he founded the Full Moon Ensemble, who achieved national recognition, toured the US and Canada as well as Scotland and recorded 5 critically acclaimed CDs. After a successful 8 year run, the FME went their separate ways and Scooter was drafted as the guitar player for the longest running Celtic band in the south, Henri’s Notions, based in Tuscaloosa, AL for over 30 years. The Notions consistently play festivals, concerts and other venues throughout the southeast and have appeared with such great artists as Bob Dylan, Paddy Obrien, Patrick Street, Brian McNeill and countless others.<br><br>
In 2005, Scooter recorded his first solo guitar CD, Saddell Abbey, with all original material as well as original music set to the poetry of Robert Burns.<br><br>
